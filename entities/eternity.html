                <p>Eternity is the Marvel cosmology given form. EVERYTHING (except House of Ideas and The Abyss) and EVERY BEING (except Oblivion, TLT and TOAA) are a part of Eternity. As such, everything regarding those apply to Eternity. [Check out <a href="../about.html#structures">Major Structures</a> and <a href="../about.html#entities">Major Entities</a>]</p>

                <p>[For dimensional stuff, check out Dimensions]</p>

                <p>Due to his nature, Eternity will be divided into two sections:</p>

              <div id="multiverse" class="content">
                <h6>THE MULTIVERSE</h6>

                <p>In the beginning, there was nothing. Then came the First Firmament. The first firmament was the first cosmology in Marvel. At the beginning it was a single "universe". It then created the first beings: The Original Celestials. The multi coloured celestials then opposed the other Celestials and the first firmament and waged a war. This war shattered the first firmament to pieces, and gave birth to the multiverse. The First Firmament became weak, and the first iteration of Eternity (the 2nd cosmos) was born. At first, it said "hundreds and hundreds" of universes were born after the shattering of the First Firmament. But the number increased gradually. At one point, the multiverse grew transinfinite (greater than infinite).</p>

                <p>More confirmation of infinite universes in the multiverse.</p>
                <p>Even more confirmation.</p>

                <p>But wait, here is the thing, There's more than one multiverse in Marvel. In fact, there is a boundless multiverse. Countless multiverses.</p>

                <p>The 2nd cosmos didn't stick around that long because it was curious about rebirth. So, it 'died' and became the 3rd iteration. The dead ruins of the 2nd cosmos later became The beyond, dimension of the Beyonders.</p>

                <p>3rd Eternity was beyond even narration. It contained only two things, All-Creation and All-Negation (More about them in <a href="oblivion.html">Oblivion</a>). The All-negation dragon itself was so big that after it broke to pieces, each piece of it went to all the universes of all the multiverses. All-Creation was originally equal to the dragon. And they were both contained inside the 3rd cosmos.</p>

                <p>The 3rd cosmos then became the 4th. 4th Eternity held archetypes and existed outside of comics, beyond The Mystery and even in The Abyss/Mountaintop. Every being in the later cosmos comes from the archetypes of the 4th Cosmos. The 4th cosmos later became <a href="never-queen.html">The Never Queen</a>.</p>

                <p>The energy that the 4th Eternity shed gave birth to the 5th Cosmos. All magic in marvel comes from 5th iteration of eternity. Fifth Eternity casually chains First Firmament and all of his other selves imprison him to the Mystery. </p>

                <p>When the 5th cosmos ended, it rebirthed to the 6th, where science flourished throughout the multiverse. Galan of Taa originated from the 6th cosmos and later transformed into galactus when the 6th cosmos transitioned into the 7th.</p>

                <p>Unlike the previous iterations, the 7th cosmos, however, had two manifestations. Eternity and Infinity. But despite appearing different, they were both one and the same.</p>

                <p>7th Multi Eternity destroys the superflow just by breaking away from his chains set by the First Firmament.</p>

                <p>7th Eternity reactively grew stronger until the First Firmament could not digest him anymore and broke out of it.</p>

                <p>A portion of Infinity can manifest inside Oblivion, and fight him metaphysically</p>

                <p>Eternity consists of even the outer-realms and meta-realms.</p>

                <p>Universal/m-body manifestation of eternity is a mere cell of Multi-eternity.</p>

                <p>A single drop of the waste of a dead multiverse gave Mephisto enough power to one shot Galactus, The Final Host and Doom the Living Planet while simultaneously breaking the god quarry.</p>

                <p>Eulogy and Expediency are writer avatars that deals with cancellation of stories inside the multiverse.</p>
              </div><!-- End of Multi Eternity -->

              <div id="universe" class="content">
                <h6>THE UNIVERSE</h6>


                <p>The universe is infinite. Each eternity ensures a boundless universe. Further confirmation universal eternity is boundless in size, its literal farthest place in known existence is incalculable. There are actually too many scans of proof of an universe in marvel being infinite in size that I can be bothered to put in this webpage. <br> Not only that, but there are actually universes and universal realms within each universes.</p>

                <p>Each moment, possibility and thought/dream creates an universe without limit.</p>

                <p>Each atoms contain their own universes.</p>
                <p>every dimensions (realms) are universes.</p>
                <p>Eternity is so transinifinite he has numerous m bodies.</p>

                <p>If that wasn't big enough, after The Reckoning War, the universe is even bigger in size now.</p>

                <p>Universal cosmic abstracts, including Eternity, operate on transinifinite level of higher existence.</p>

                <p>Bythos is Plato's realm of ideas, and consists of true platonic concepts. Sophia, is another realm which transcended Bythos and multiplied infinitely outwards and inwards. And they both are merely part of the universe.</p>

                <p>The Griever At The End Of All Things is a true platonic concept of "finality". And she is only a mere essence of the universe.</p>

                <p>A small portion of universal eternity, used as the eternity mask, views everything as narration.</p>

                <p>The eternity mask tanked and survived the blade of creation and the destruction of the All-Negation</p>

                <p>His very m-body is also concepts given manifestation.</p>

                <p>Eternity connects everyone, including the avatar of John Bryne (the writer of the comic) to himself, to show the importance of Galactus in the universe and then later mind wipes them.</p>

                <p>Eternity can retcon events through plot manipulation.</p>

                <p>Brings forth all of Adam's conceptual manifestations and merges them with him and brings him back to life. Adam himself isn't bound by any polarities of life.</p>
                <p>Can send physical objects manifested from the dream plane to the physical plane.</p>

                <p>Casually consigns an amped Nightmare to Oblivion.</p>

                <p>Can make and control laws that not even Living tribunal is not allowed to do anything about.</p>

                <p>The infinity gauntlet can't keep Eternity's core essence captivated.</p>
                <p>Magus with the infinity gauntlet can't perceive eternity.</p>

                <p>Eternity is forever, and can appear and have a whole discussion in between The Stranger's rhythm of heartbeat, who himself is an abstract and not bound by time.</p>

                <p>His mere dreams become reality unto creation.</p>

                <p>Captures and restrains death. His punch atomizes and scatters beings into himself.</p>

                <p>Banishes The In-Betweener.</p>

                <p>Eternity and TLT are unaffected by the destruction of the universe and can stand outside of it.</p>

                <p>Makes the Beyonder and Protégé (who was equal to Beyonder in every aspect) think they blew Eternity out. Also explains his single uni manifestation is dictated by the Beyonder's "limited comprehension" and his true abstract form is not perceivable by even them.</p>

                <p>It was believed uni Eternity could generate enough power to obliterate the Beyonder (but this theory went untested as Mephisto couldn't get Eternity to fire on Beyonder when he had the chance).</p>

                <p>Eternity's voice alone is in higher planes of existence and echoes thru the entire universe.</p>

                <p>The only thing Atum has nightmares about is Eternity.</p>

                <p>Casually takes all of Classic strange's magic away.<br>
                With a mere gesture, turned classic strange (who was at the height of his powers) into an insect like thing.</p>

                <p>An small portion of Eternity turns into 3 human beings. Just the mere act of these 3 returning to Eternity's essence shakes hades (hell).</p>

                <p>A fraction of uni Eternity considered The War of the Seven Spheres to be not worth his time. Even the combined power of the Vishanti were having trouble in that war. He then proceeds to pull out the Ancient One out of himself to do battle for him.</p>

                <p>Same fraction of eternity mind wipes classic strange of the memory of meeting him.</p>
